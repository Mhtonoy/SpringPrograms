In normal projects we have to download the **jar** files manually. But when we create **MAVEN** project, we provide **dependencies**, through which **jar** files are automatically downloaded. We don't need to download the jar files manually and add them in project.

The required **jar** files are:
   1.   spring-beans-xxx.jar
   2.   spring-core-xxx.jar
   3.   spring-context-xxx.jar
   4.   common-logging-xxx.jar
   5.   spring-expression-xxx.jar
   
All required jar files are available at [**springjars**](springjars) folder.
