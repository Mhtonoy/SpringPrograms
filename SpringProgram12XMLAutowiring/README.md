# Autowiring
-	It is the feature of Spring Framework by which we can achieve "DI automatically".

-	**Auto** means automatically manages the connection between objects. **Wiring** means linking those objects together to fulfill dependencies.

-	Autowiring can be achieved by:
		1.	Annotation based autowiring.
		2.	XML based autowiring.
